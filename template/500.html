<h3>500 - That's an error.</h3>
Possible causes:<br>
-Some of the inputs contained faulty or empty values. I didn't attach readable tags to them so no idea which.<br>
-I just messed up some of the code (and maybe didn't even notice).<br>
Either way, please use back button of browser to return to previous page and check your inputs. Good luck!<br>
